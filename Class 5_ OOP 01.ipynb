Encapsulation\n","\n","**Concept**  \n","- Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a single class.  \n","- It also involves restricting direct access to some components of an object, often through naming conventions in Python (_protected-like, __private-like).  \n","- This practice protects an object’s internal state and behavior from unintended interference.\n","\n","**Car Part Analogy**  \n","- When you start a car by turning a key or pushing a button, you don’t directly ignite the engine’s spark plugs.  \n","- All the complex details of how the engine operates are hidden from the driver, illustrating how encapsulation keeps internal mechanisms private.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**  \n","- Encapsulation shields internal workings (e.g., the engine) behind a simple interface (e.g., “start the car”).  \n","- It promotes data integrity by controlling access to class attributes and methods.\n","\n","![Diagram illustrating encapsulation in a car's engine](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7GNY5ha6BGhkKQXUCzI081_vq2-9z8_B42n9aYC17nBRGkUD2G3Ma1lyzkFwGF3fj4d2TVijl7b7ujjnXgs_4aYhIofWrDSnrONBKd9ouSJxq4GAk2oScR3Z7szmnHRicfiEaOsTteyhHk33Ep7BsG997p57pXpXUQcwuZwMfAk_3zry5zqp3aUpehQ/s800/encapsulation-real-time-example-car-engine.jpg)\n","\n","In object-oriented programming, encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class. This concept is akin to a car's engine system, where the complex mechanics are hidden from the driver, who interacts with simple interfaces like the steering wheel and pedals. This separation ensures that the internal workings are protected from unauthorized access and misuse, promoting modularity and maintainability in software design.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4o7jKmu795fW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. Inheritance\n","\n","**Concept**  \n","- Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to derive from another class (parent/superclass).  \n","- It enables the child class to reuse and extend the functionality of the parent class, promoting code reusability and logical organization.\n","\n","**Car Part Analogy**  \n","- A general Car class can have attributes like brand and model.  \n","- A GasCar subclass inherits those general attributes but adds features specific to gasoline engines (e.g., fuel capacity).  \n","- An ElectricCar subclass might inherit the same core features but add a battery capacity attribute.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**  \n","- Inheritance establishes an “is-a” relationship (e.g., “A GasCar is a Car”).  \n","- Subclasses retain parent class methods and attributes, while specializing them for distinct needs.\n","\n","![Object-Oriented Programming Diagram](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53d60643e4b05dcadd61bb4b/1452660146112-V6JSOIWU94XSNBADHLJD/image-asset.jpeg)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rKKjJr7q9-wI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3.
