You could have one \"container\" that holds the number of apples on the shelf, and another for the price of each apple.\n","- **Instruction**: Label these containers as `apple_count` for the quantity and `apple_price` for the cost per apple, so you can reference them by name in your calculations or decisions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2) Data Types\n","- **Concept**: Data can come in different forms (like text, numbers, or true/false values). Each form is a data type.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: In your store:\n","  - The quantity of apples is an integer (e.g., 50).\n","  - The price of an apple is a floating-point number (e.g., 0.99).\n","  - The store name is a string (e.g., \"Fresh Mart\").\n","  - Whether the store is open or closed is a boolean (e.g., true or false).\n","- **Instruction**: Decide the most suitable type (integer, float, string, boolean) for the information you store.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3) Dynamic Types\n","- **Concept**: In some languages, you can change the type of a variable without error. The variable is not restricted to a single data type.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: You might record `apple_price` as a float (e.g., 0.99), but later decide to record it as a string (e.g., \"N/A\") because apples are temporarily out of stock. The same variable name is reused for different data types.\n","- **Instruction**: Be mindful of how reusing a variable for different data types can affect the logic of your program.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4) If Statements\n","- **Concept**: An if statement allows your program to make decisions and execute certain actions only if specific conditions are true.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: If your store is open and the apple stock is above 0, you might display a sign \"Apples available!\". Otherwise, you show \"Out of stock!\".\n","- **Instruction**: Use an if statement to check your current stock level before deciding to display an \"available\" message or \"out of stock\" message.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5) Logical Operators\n","- **Concept**: Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) combine or negate conditions.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: In your store, you may want to check if (`apple_stock > 0` **and** `banana_stock > 0`) to see if both items are available, or check if (`apple_stock > 0` **or** `banana_stock > 0`) to see if at least one is available.\n","- **Instruction**: Decide if you need both conditions to be true (`and`) or just at least one (`or`), or if you should flip a condition (`not`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6) Comparison/Relational/Conditional Operators\n","- **Concept**: These operators (like `>`, `<`, `==`) let you compare values.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: To evaluate daily sales goals, compare `total_sales` with your `daily_goal`: if `total_sales > daily_goal`, the day is successful.\n","- **Instruction**: Use these operators to compare quantities, prices, or other store metrics to automate decisions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7) For Loops\n","- **Concept**: A for loop runs a block of instructions multiple times, usually over a sequence (like a list).\n","- **Real-Life Example**: You might have a list of items: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"milk\", \"bread\"]. You use a for loop to process each item (e.g., print labels or check each price).\n","- **Instruction**: Use a for loop to go through your product list and perform an action for each product in your inventory.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8) While Loops\n","- **Concept**: A while loop runs as long as a certain condition remains true.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: You might reorder apples while your `apple_stock` is below 10. The loop continues until the stock is at least 10.\n","- **Instruction**: Be careful with the condition to avoid infinite loops, and update the condition inside the loop.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9) Break & Continue Statements\n","- **Concept**:\n","  - **Break** exits the current loop immediately.\n","  - **Continue** skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves on to the next iteration.\n","- **Real-Life Example**:\n","  - **Break**: If you’re scanning items in a list and find a “DISCONTINUED” product, stop processing further products.\n","  - **Continue**: If you’re printing labels but find one product that doesn't need a label, skip it and move on.\n","- **Instruction**: Use `break` or `continue` to control the flow in loops when certain conditions are met or not met.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 10) Strings\n","- **Concept**: A string represents text. You can join, split, and manipulate these text values.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Storing your store’s name (\"Fresh Mart\") or a promotional slogan (\"Buy 1 Get 1 Free!\").\n","- **Instruction**: Use string methods (like upper/lower, splitting, or replacing characters) to format or process textual information.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 11) Arithmetic Operations\n","- **Concept**: Basic math operators (+, -, *, /, etc.) let you do calculations.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Calculating the total cost of items in a grocery cart, adding tax, or calculating discounts.\n","- **Instruction**: Carefully track your arithmetic operations when managing store finance or inventory (e.g., new_stock = old_stock - items_sold).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 12) Operator Precedence\n","- **Concept**: Certain operators take priority over others when evaluating expressions.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: When calculating discounts and tax in one formula, multiplication (for tax) happens before addition/subtraction unless you use parentheses to change order.\n","- **Instruction**: Use parentheses to ensure calculations happen in the correct sequence (e.g., (subtotal - discount) * tax).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 13) Math Functions\n","- **Concept**: Functions like `round`, `ceil`, or `floor` help with precise numeric operations.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Rounding up the price to the nearest cent, or rounding down to give a customer discount.\n","- **Instruction**: Apply these functions to handle currency neatly, ensuring no fractional cents in final billing.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 14) Lists\n","- **Concept**: A list is an ordered collection that can be changed (mutable).\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Storing your weekly grocery items: [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"milk\"].\n","- **Instruction**: Use lists when you need to add or remove items dynamically (e.g., new products or sold-out products).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 15) List Methods\n","- **Concept**: Lists come with built-in methods like `append`, `remove`, etc.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Adding a new product to your store inventory list (`append`) or removing a sold-out product (`remove`).\n","- **Instruction**: Explore methods (`sort`, `reverse`, `index`, etc.) to organize or retrieve items efficiently.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 16) Dictionaries\n","- **Concept**: A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Product stock levels: {\"apple\": 50, \"banana\": 30}.\n","- **Instruction**: Use dictionaries when you need a fast lookup for data by labels. For instance, checking product_stock[\"apple\"] to see how many apples are left.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 17) Functions\n","- **Concept**: A function groups code into a reusable block that performs a specific task.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: A function that calculates total sales for a day, so you can call it anytime you need that calculation.\n","- **Instruction**: Define functions for repeated tasks—like calculating totals, applying tax, or generating invoices.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 18) Parameters/Arguments\n","- **Concept**: A function can accept parameters to work with different inputs each time it’s called.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: A function `calculate_tax` might take a `subtotal` parameter so it can compute tax on any given amount.\n","- **Instruction**: Provide arguments to the function when you call it, like `calculate_tax(150.00)`, to handle various scenarios.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 19) Keyword Parameters/Arguments\n","- **Concept**: When calling a function, you can specify arguments by name, making it clearer and avoiding mistakes in order.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: `apply_discount(price=10.99, discount=0.2)` clarifies which value is the price and which is the discount.\n","- **Instruction**: Use keyword arguments when a function has many parameters or when the order of arguments might be confusing.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 20) Default Parameter Value\n","- **Concept**: You can assign a default value to a function parameter, making it optional to provide that argument.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: A function `add_tax(amount, rate=0.07)` can assume 7% as the default tax rate if none is provided.\n","- **Instruction**: Use default values for parameters that have a common or standard setting, like a local tax rate.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 21) Return Statement\n","- **Concept**: A return statement ends a function’s execution and sends back a value to the caller.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: A function might return the final bill amount after calculating taxes and discounts.\n","- **Instruction**: Use `return` to provide meaningful output from your functions—like returning a subtotal after all discounts.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 22) Set (Union/Intersection/Difference)\n","- **Concept**: Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They have special operations:\n","  - **Union** combines all unique elements from both sets.\n","  - **Intersection** finds elements that appear in both sets.\n","  - **Difference** finds elements in one set but not in the other.\n","- **Real-Life Example**:\n","  - `fruits_set` could contain all fruits your store sells.\n","  - `tropical_set` might contain a list of known tropical fruits.\n","  - Find the union to see *all* fruits, the intersection to see which are tropical and sold in your store, or the difference to see non-tropical items.\n","- **Instruction**: Use sets for quick membership checks or when you don’t need duplicated items in your data.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 23) Tuples\n","- **Concept**: A tuple is an ordered collection that cannot be changed (immutable).\n","- **Real-Life Example**: Storing the dimensions of a banner (width, height). Those numbers are unlikely to change once printed, so a tuple might be ideal.\n","- **Instruction**: Use a tuple if you have a fixed set of values that shouldn’t be modified after creation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 24) Unpacking/Comparing\n","- **Concept**: You can “unpack” tuples or other collections into separate variables. You can also compare them in a straightforward way.\n","- **Real-Life Example**: If you have dimensions `(width, height)`, you can unpack them into two variables `w, h` without referencing indices.\n","- **Instruction**: This makes your code more readable and avoids manual indexing (like using `[0]` and `[1]`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 25) Difference Between List and Tuple\n","- **Concept**:\n","  - A **list** is mutable (you can add, remove, or change items).\n","  - A **tuple** is immutable (you cannot change its items once defined).\n","- **Real-Life Example**:\n","  - Use a **list** for day-to-day stock updates.\n","  - Use a **tuple** for store location coordinates that never change.\n","- **Instruction**: Choose lists when the data needs to change over time, and tuples for fixed, unalterable data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-8iqfXj0LsBj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"HCyRI3kFLsiJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
